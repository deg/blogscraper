# Blogscraper

**Blogscraper** is a Python-based tool designed to scrape and summarize recent articles
from selected AI and software development blogs. It extracts interesting URLs, fetches
their content, and optionally prepares the data for further analysis or for input into a
Large Language Model (LLM).

This directory is the Blogscraper's FastAPI server.
