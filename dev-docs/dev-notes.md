Notes and ideas that are either internal or not ready for prime time.

## Tooling ideas

### Preparing LLM content

We are using [gitingest](https://gitingest.com/) to create LLM-ready copies of the
repo. This is one of multiple tools that do this task. I chose this one because it is
the smoothest to integrate with a Python workflow.  Other useful tools include
[repomix](https://repomix.com/).

### Scraping websites

See [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/), though it has only a minimal free tier.
