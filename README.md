# Blogscraper

**Blogscraper** is a Python-based tool designed to scrape and summarize recent articles
from selected AI and software development blogs. It extracts interesting URLs, fetches
their content, and optionally prepares the data for further analysis or for input into a
Large Language Model (LLM).

This project also began as an experiment with the LLM-aided
[project design ideas](https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/)
published by Harper Reed, and with [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) and
[SpecStory](https://specstory.com/).

## Motivation

In the rapidly evolving fields of AI and software development, staying updated with the
latest information is crucial yet challenging. New articles, tutorials, and insights are
published daily across numerous platforms, making it difficult to keep
track. **Blogscraper** addresses this challenge by automating the process of collecting
and summarizing recent blog posts, ensuring that users have timely access to relevant
information without the need for manual tracking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.11
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (dependency management)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:deg/blogscraper.git
cd blogscraper
```

Set up the environment:

```bash
make setup-dev-env
```

This command will install dependencies, set up Git hooks, and prepare your environment.

## Running Blogscraper

### Execution

Start the program with Make:

```bash
make run
```

This will take you into a simple CLI UI:

```plaintext
$ make run
ðŸš€ Running the application...
poetry run python -m blogscraper.main

```

Blogscraper search for recent blog posts from a number of sites. The list is currently
hardcoded but extensible, with custom scrapers for each site. We are looking to automate
this process. [HELP-WANTED].

You can then filter this list to retain only the most recent posts.

Finally, you can output these in one or more formats:

## Blogscraper Outputs

Blogscraper provides several output formats to accommodate different workflows:

- **Full page contents**: The main content of the blog posts, in Markdown format, and
  with extraneous page wrappers removed.
- **List of URLs**: A simple list of scraped URLs that can be used for further
  exploration or as input to other tools.
- **Consolidated document**: Generate a Google Doc with all the blog posts' content and
  header data. This is a great format to pass into tools like
  [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/).
- **LLM Prompts**: This is still experimental and only marginally useful. Generate an
  LLM prompt designed to guide AI models in processing and summarizing blog
  content. [HELP-WANTED]

## Available Commands in the Makefile

Use the Makefile to perform common tasks:

```bash
make help
```

Commands include:

- `make setup-dev-env`: Prepare your development environment
- `make run`: Execute the main application
- `make lint`: Check code quality using Black, isort, Ruff, Pyright, and MyPy
- `make test`: Run unit tests (Still rudimentary) [HELP-WANTED]
- `make coverage`: Check test coverage and ensure it meets the required threshold
- `make outdated`: Show outdated dependencies
- `make as-llm-input`: Generate a copy of the repository, suitable for passing to LLM tools
